========

Fig Leaf is an utility that creates an encrypted copy of your folders. It synchronizes the content of the source folder(s) with the target folder and encrypts all files in the target folder at the same time. The goal of this program is to provide the basic protection of your photos and videos before uploading them to some cloud storage such as Dropbox, SkyDrive, etc.

To simplify the browsing of the encrypted folder it does the following:

- preserves the inner folder and files structure,
- keeps the original file date and time,
- allows to create thumbnails for your photos and videos that would be put nearby encrypted files.

File protection provided by the simple zip archiving with password. So, you become not dependent on this program and can decrypt your files with any other zip unpack program. To improve protection, FigLeaf allows to add some variability of passwords, making them dependent on the single master password and the file name being encrypted.
